## Description
This Python script is a demonstration of fundamental programming concepts including recursion, searching, and sorting in Python. It includes functions to duplicate items in a list using linear recursion, search for an item in a list, and sort a list using Python's built-in methods.

## Features
- **Linear Recursive Duplication:** Duplicates each item in a list using linear recursion, resulting in a new list with each element appearing twice.
- **Search Item:** Utilizes Python's built-in search capabilities to find an item in a list.
- **Sort List:** Sorts a list in ascending order using Python's built-in sort method.

## Functions
### 1. Linear Recursive Duplication
```python
def linear_recursive_duplicate(lst):
